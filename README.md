![Blinkit Logo](https://github.com/konetipavankalyan626/Blinkit_Analysis_Python-Project/blob/main/blinkit_logo.png)

## Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Blinkit dataset** using Python.  
The analysis uncovers insights about sales, outlet performance, item visibility, fat content, and outlet types.  

The project is designed for aspiring **Data Analysts** to showcase skills in:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Business Insights Generation

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning and analysis  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive coding and visualization

## Bussiness Requirements
In the competitive retail industry, businesses like **Blinkit** generate massive amounts of sales and outlet data. However, raw data alone cannot provide actionable insights unless it is properly analyzed.  

Key challenges include:  
- Identifying which **outlet sizes** and **types** contribute most to revenue.  
- Understanding the impact of **item visibility** and **fat content** on sales.  
- Finding patterns that can improve **inventory planning** and **marketing strategies**.  
Without structured analysis, valuable opportunities for business growth and optimization may be overlooked.
